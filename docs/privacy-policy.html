      <h1>Talk Mate Privacy Policy</h1>
      <div class="meta">
        <p><strong>Effective date:</strong> February 16, 2026</p>
        <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> February 16, 2026</p>
        <p><strong>App:</strong> Talk Mate</p>
        <p><strong>Operator:</strong> ojuni</p>
      </div>

      

      <h2>1. Scope</h2>
      <p>
        This Privacy Policy explains how Talk Mate collects, uses, shares, and stores information
        when you use the mobile app, related backend services, and connected payment features.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>

      <h3>2.1 Account and identity data</h3>
      <p>When you sign in with Google through Supabase Authentication, we process:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Supabase user ID</li>
        <li>Email address</li>
        <li>Name and profile image (if available from Google)</li>
        <li>Authentication provider metadata</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2.2 Conversation and translation data</h3>
      <p>
        If you are signed in, Talk Mate stores your conversation history in Supabase, including:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Original text and translated text</li>
        <li>Speaker role (A/B), timestamps, and session IDs</li>
        <li>Conversation title, preview text, message counts, and pin status</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2.3 Audio and speech processing data</h3>
      <p>Talk Mate uses microphone input for voice features.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Legacy voice mode sends audio to Google Speech-to-Text to transcribe speech.</li>
        <li>
          Continuous duplex mode streams audio to Talk Mate's voice gateway, which uses Google Cloud
          Speech-to-Text, Translation, and Text-to-Speech.
        </li>
        <li>
          Generated TTS audio is returned for playback. We do not intentionally publish raw user audio
          publicly.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2.4 Subscription and billing data</h3>
      <p>For in-app purchases, we use RevenueCat and app store billing systems.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>RevenueCat app user mapping (Supabase user ID)</li>
        <li>Entitlement status (for example, <code>Talk Mate Pro</code>)</li>
        <li>Product identifiers, expiry timestamps, and sync timestamps</li>
        <li>Webhook event IDs used for idempotency and fraud/misconfiguration protection</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Payment card details are processed by Apple App Store / Google Play and are not stored by Talk
        Mate servers.
      </p>

      <h3>2.5 Voice quota and usage enforcement data</h3>
      <p>To enforce free-tier limits and premium access, we process:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Daily voice usage counters (milliseconds used per UTC day)</li>
        <li>Remaining quota and paywall-required state</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2.6 Rewarded ads data (non-premium fallback)</h3>
      <p>
        On Android, Talk Mate may show rewarded ads through Google AdMob for eligible non-premium
        users.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Ad request and interaction events (through AdMob SDK)</li>
        <li>Device/advertising identifiers and network metadata handled by Google AdMob</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2.7 AI-generated conversation title data</h3>
      <p>
        If enabled, Talk Mate may send a small subset of recent translated conversation messages to
        Google's Gemini API to generate short conversation titles.
      </p>

      <h3>2.8 Local on-device storage</h3>
      <p>Talk Mate stores limited local cache data on your device, such as:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Theme preference</li>
        <li>Cached signed-in profile snapshot</li>
        <li>Cached conversation snippets for faster reload</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2.9 Operational logs</h3>
      <p>
        We may process technical logs and performance metrics (for example latency metrics, socket
        errors, and billing check errors) for reliability and abuse prevention.
      </p>

      <h2>3. How We Use Information</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Provide speech recognition, translation, and text-to-speech features</li>

        <li>Authenticate users and secure app sessions</li>
        <li>Provide, sync, and enforce subscriptions and entitlement status</li>
        <li>Enforce free-tier voice quotas and paywall rules</li>
        <li>Offer rewarded ad continuation paths for eligible non-premium users</li>
        <li>Improve reliability, troubleshoot, and prevent abuse or fraud</li>
      </ul>

        <li>Legal obligations (tax, audit, or compliance requirements)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        We may also disclose data when required by law, to enforce terms, or to protect rights, safety,

      </p>

      <h2>6. Data Retention</h2>

      <p>
        We use reasonable technical and organizational safeguards, including authenticated access,
        row-level security policies in Supabase, and server-side entitlement enforcement. No system is
        100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.

      <h2>9. Do Not Sell or Share (US State Notices)</h2>
      <p>
        Talk Mate does not sell your personal information for money. Ad-related processing by third-party
        SDKs may be considered "sharing" or targeted advertising under some laws; you can limit this via
        device privacy settings and applicable consent controls.
      </p>

      <h2>10. Children's Privacy</h2>
      <p>
        Talk Mate is not directed to children under 13 (or the equivalent minimum age in your
        jurisdiction). If you believe a child provided personal data, contact us so we can take
        appropriate action.
      </p>

      <h2>11. International Data Transfers</h2>
      <p>
        Your data may be processed in countries other than your own by our service providers. Where
        required, we apply appropriate safeguards for cross-border transfers.
      </p>

      <h2>12. Changes to This Policy</h2>
